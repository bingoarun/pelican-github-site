Summary: About me

I am currently working as Senior Operations engineer in Directi Web Technology (Endurance International Group).

Previously I worked with couple of startups taking care of their cloud environments deployed on AWS and GCE and using Openstack.

I not only love learning new technologies, but also apply them practically to solve real world problems. I also love Python programming and am interested in automating stuffs.
My technology stack includes but not limited to Openstack, Python, Puppet, Ansible and Docker.

My favorite Linux Operating systems is Fedora and I use Windows 10 mainly for gaming.

In my free time I watch TEDx talks, explore opensource tools and try to contribute to them. I also like PC games a lot. My favorites are RTS games (BFME 1&2, RON, AOE series)
