PERSONAL_INFO = """My name is Ken Lai, a network engineer who is working & living in Shenzhen, China. I've spent about 10 years in network industry from doing operational routines at first, to work as a tech consultant with my sales partner in one of the greatest company in this world. I also do program work a lot as a personal hobby in my part-time. I learnt variety of languages, like C, C++, ASM, Object-Pascal since 6th grade in elementary school. But Python has been my favorite since I knew it for the first time in 2006. Also, English is my second language while my mother tongue is Madrin. I can speak some Japanese, and now is  preparing for the official Japanese certification."""
